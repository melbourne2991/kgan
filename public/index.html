							<h3>An insatiable appetite for knowledge</h3>

								<p>
								I started learning graphic design and web development when I was about 16 or so (back when tables were still a thing), and I don't plan to stop any time soon. Given I have no prior plans, I will spend <strong>3-5 hours</strong> each day working on my own personal projects (currently learning game development with <a href="http://phaser.io/" target="_blank">Phaser</a>).  I am constantly reading up on both tech and web development, at lunchtime, on the toilet, in the car, on the train...you name it.

								<p>I hate writing crappy code and avoid it like the plague. I care a lot about what I put out there. Admittedly in the real world we don't always have the opportunity write perfect code every time, but I'm looking for a company that at least <strong>understands</strong> the value of top notch code. </p>

I try to put myself in the shoes of upper management, asking myself how I might tackle high level challenges. If I think I have something worth contributing, I'm not afraid to make myself heard.</p>

									I left this one til last because I believe my <a href="http://github.com/melbourne2991" target="_blank">GitHub account</a> speaks for itself. There are also a couple of examples of my work you will find below. I also put this little site together of course (<strong>built in Angular</strong>), it was a bit of a rush job - I know Nitin wanted me to get this over to you fast, however the code isn't terrible so feel free to check the source.

					<h2>Technically speaking...</h2>
					<div id="techs">
						<ul class="tick-list">
							<li><span class="tick">&#10004;</span><h4>Javascript Gun - Frontend/Backend</h4>
								<p>I have worked with node, angular, backbone, jquery, jqueryui and lodash (underscore's baby brother). At my current role I have built a number of production apps - a Zendesk app for managing rewards, an administration app for a store locator and a number of event management applications. </p>
							</li>
							<li><span class="tick">&#10004;</span><h4>Sass, Less, Jade, Haml</h4> 
								<p>Preprocessors are awesome, I tend to work with Sass more so than the other three but will use them occassionally depending on the task at hand</p>
							</li>
							<li><span class="tick">&#10004;</span><h4>CSS Frameworks</h4>	
								I used to use Bootstrap, I then moved on to Foundation, these days I tend to use my own css as I find most frameworks are too heavy weight for what needs to be done. That said I am perfectly happy using css frameworks if it means providing consistency across a team.
							</li>
							<li><span class="tick">&#10004;</span><h4>Grunt / Gulp</h4>	
								I use grunt primarily for minifying and compiling assets, and running unit tests. Just started delving into Gulp.
